           hours and hours without getting bored and tired as I enjoy playing 
            it a lot.It is also fun and easy to learn.Playing basketball has a lot of advantages like it improves our balance and coordination,builds endurance,build up muscle,burn calories (an hour of basketball can burn 630–750 calories),develop concentration and self-discipline.Besides all this it also helps to increase our
